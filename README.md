=> Career Prediction and Guiding system using Random Forest Classifier and OpenAI.
=> This project predicts a suitable career path using a machine learning model based on  Random Forest Classification. After prediction, the system uses the "OpenAI API" to provide personalized career guidance.

=> Features

1.Career prediction using a Random Forest Classifier.
2.Personalized guidance from OpenAI's GPT model.
3.Backend built with FastAPI.
4.Frontend UI to display guidance to users.
5.Secure API key handling using environment variables.

**Note** :
=> To run this project, **you must use your own OpenAI API key**.  
=> For better free-tier limits, I recommend using the **Cohere OpenAI API**, which often provides more free searches than the default OpenAI service.
